//=== Extreme Networks

==== Access points AP305C (managed by Extreme Cloud IQ Controller)

In such deployment, PacketFence communicate directly with access
points using RADIUS. Extreme Cloud IQ controller is only used to configure
access points in a central place.

===== Web authentication

====== Extreme Cloud IQ Controller

On Extreme Cloud IQ Controller, you should have builtin IP Firewall policies:

* Redirect-only policy: this policy must have "redirect" rules
* Internet-access-only policy

On Extreme Cloud IQ Controller, create two user profiles:

* Registration
** VLAN: 5
** Firewall rules: Enabled
** IP Firewall Name: Redirect-only policy
** Redirect URL: http://192.168.1.5/Extreme::AP
* Guest
** VLAN: 5
** Firewall rules: Enabled
** IP Firewall Name: Internet-access-only policy

On Extreme Cloud IQ Controller, create a wireless network with following configuration:

* SSID Authentication: Open
** Enable Captive Web Portal: No
* MAC Authentication tab
** Enable MAC authentication: Yes
** Authentication protocol: CHAP
** Authenticate via RADIUS server
*** Create a RADIUS group with an External RADIUS Server
**** Permit Dynamic Change Of Authorization Messages (RFC 3576): Enabled
** User access settings
*** Apply a different user profile to various clients and user groups: Enabled
**** Allow user profile assignment using RADIUS attributes in addition to the three tunnel RADIUS attributes: Enabled
***** Standard RADIUS Attribute: Filter-Id

Under User access settings, you need to create following rules:

.User Access Settings rules
|===
| User profile name | VLAN/VLAN Group | Assignment rules

| Registration      |  5              | If Filter-ID equals "Registration"
| Guest             |  5              | If Filter-ID equals "Guest"
|===

====== PacketFence

Create a switch with following configuration:

* Definition tab
** Identifier: subnet of your Extreme AP
** External portal enforcement: Yes
** Deauthentication method: RADIUS
* Roles tab
** Role by Switch Role: Yes
*** registration: Registration
*** guest: Guest
